Depending on the arguments you give:

  - Giving two invalid arguments will return a message stating `Please use numbers as the arguments.`
  - Giving two numerical arguments will return a random number between those two numbers

If the arguents (next words passed after visual) are `basic` AND `sucks`, the bot will respond with `I agree.`. If the argument is ONLY `basic`, the bot will respond with `VISUAL BASIC SUCKS`. If the arguments are none of the above, the bot will not respond with anything.
